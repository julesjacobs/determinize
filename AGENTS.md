# Agent Guidelines

- After completing any task, trigger an audible notification using macOS `say`.
  - Example: `say "Task complete"`
  - Customize the phrase to describe which task was completed, but keep it short and clear.
  - You do not need to explain your `say` usage in your final message -- the main purpose is to notify the user.
- Always make sure that code / tex builds after making changes.
- Monitor TODO.md and mark items as completed as you work through them.
